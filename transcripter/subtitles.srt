00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,080
hi I'm Steve Clemens and I have a

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,200
question if Israel's war has gone Way

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,480
Beyond self-defense to the point of

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
making the Gaza Strip itself completely

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,759
unlivable why is the Biden

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,679
Administration supporting it let's get

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,280
to the bottom

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,640
line in less than 3 months Israel has

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,800
killed nearly 1% of the Palestinian

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,199
people living in the Gaza Strip to put

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,720
that in perspective 1% of the population

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,119
of America would be more than 3 million

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,480
people that's like wiping out an entire

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,840
State like Arkansas or Nevada and so far

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,000
there's just no end in sight hundreds of

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
innocent civilians mostly women and

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,879
children are killed by Israeli forces

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,719
daily and almost 100% of the people

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,039
living there are now displaced that's

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,360
100% they're desperate they're hungry

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,879
they're cold Israeli and US officials

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,600
are acting as if the Palestinians should

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,920
blame themselves because Hamas carried

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,879
out a surprise attack in October that

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
killed about 1,200 Israeli soldiers and

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,320
civilians but when a country wages a war

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,200
it usually has a specific outcome that

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,640
it's looking for so what's the endgame

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,880
for Israel today we're talking with one

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,759
of America's most influential thinkers

31
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,960
John mimer professor of political

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,320
science at the University of Chicago and

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
author of the Israel Lobby and US

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
foreign policy as well as most recently

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,680
how States think the rationality of

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
foreign policy John it's terrific to be

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,119
with you today thank you so much for

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,360
joining us

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,799
um you wrote a piece this week death and

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,479
destruction in Gaza in which you said

41
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,799
that we've reached a point where there

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,240
is simply no meaningful military purpose

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,960
in Israel's war tell us what you

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,079
meant well when it comes to what Israel

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,640
is doing in Gaza you have to distinguish

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,920
between going after

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,479
Hamas and punishing the civilian

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,439
population and when we talk about

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,119
punishing the civilian population we're

50
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,920
talking about killing murdering huge

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,439
numbers of civilians displacing them

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,920
from their home starving large chunks of

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,000
the Palestinian population inside Gaza

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
and so forth and so on these are

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,680
basically war crimes I don't think there

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,480
are many people who would dispute that

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,640
Israel has what we call the right to go

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,560
after Hamas Hamas attacked Israel

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,560
Israel's going after Hamas that's not

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
really a contested issue for the most

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,560
part but what the Israelis are doing is

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,200
they're going far beyond going after

63
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,920
Hamas and they are inflicting massive

64
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
pain and Punishment on the civilian

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,519
population and in my opinion this should

66
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,959
be unacceptable to decent people all

67
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,280
over the world and the idea that the

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,879
Biden Administration is not only

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,000
sanctioning this but supporting it it's

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,120
very important to understand that the

71
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Israelis could not conduct this

72
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,480
punishment campaign without support from

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,280
the United States they need American

74
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,680
military weaponry and furthermore they

75
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,720
need American diplomatic support and we

76
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,440
are giving that to them so we are as as

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,200
deeply involved in this disaster this

78
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,040
humanitarian disaster as the Israelis

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
themselves are do you find that there's

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,000
a worry that America's on the wrong side

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,040
of this no I think there's widespread

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,640
support in inside the American Body

83
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,519
politic uh for uh uh the Palestinian

84
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,040
civilian population I mean I don't think

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,360
there's any question that lots of people

86
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,319
think that what the Israelis are doing

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,319
to the civilian population is deeply

88
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,120
wrong there's no question there uh a lot

89
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,760
of people won't voice their opinion on

90
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,360
this issue publicly uh and that's in

91
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
large part because they fear that the

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,840
Israel Lobby will Target them and that

93
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,400
will do damage to their career uh

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,040
there's all sorts of evidence that

95
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,239
people on college and university

96
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,079
campuses are self- censoring for fear of

97
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,400
the Israel lobby but even there it's

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,640
clear that there's just widespread

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
support uh for uh the Palestinian people

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,239
and widespread criticism of what Israel

101
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,040
is

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
doing what would you be advising

103
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,800
President Biden early on in this

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,240
conflict if you were trying to advise

105
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,199
him or the Israelis how to respond after

106
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,160
October

107
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,680
7th well I think in the beginning uh

108
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Biden should have gone to Great Lengths

109
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,320
to tell the Israelis to make sure that

110
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,800
uh they executed a measured response and

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,520
that they did not

112
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,919
overreact and he should have made it

113
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,280
clear that uh he would support the

114
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,800
Israelis against Hamas uh I mean he had

115
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,080
no choice there for sure

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,639
but he also should have made it clear to

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,400
the Israelis that uh if they went after

118
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,520
the civilian population the way they are

119
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,440
going after the civilian population uh

120
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
the United States would go to Great

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,280
Lengths to throttle uh Israel's attempts

122
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,400
uh to murder huge numbers of civilians

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,639
that's what he should have done we

124
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,360
should be on the other side of the

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,160
divide with regard to this campaign this

126
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,720
bombing campaign that the Israelis are w

127
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,680
in uh against uh the Palestinian

128
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,759
civilians and by the way it's not just a

129
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,199
bombing campaign uh the Israelis are

130
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,800
trying to starve uh large numbers of

131
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,919
Palestinians to death they've made that

132
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,960
very clear it's not like I'm making this

133
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,560
up the Israelis themselves say that this

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
is exactly what they're doing uh if you

135
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,000
look at what the Israelis are saying

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,520
about uh the Palestinians how they

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,720
describe the Palestinians talking about

138
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,600
them as human animals uh and so forth

139
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,520
and so on and then you you talk you

140
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,560
listen to what they're saying when they

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,360
talk about what they intend to do uh to

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,560
Gaza you know they talk about flattening

143
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,240
leveling it eradicating it uh you see

144
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,800
very clearly that they are purposely uh

145
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,680
targeting uh the civilian population and

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,280
they are doing massive amounts of

147
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,120
killing John if killing 1% of the

148
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,919
population so many innocent people isn't

149
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,919
a red line for the neighborhood for

150
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,800
Egypt for Jordan for other nations

151
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,319
around there for the United States are

152
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,000
we all just in a in a performance act

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,440
right now saying Israel please don't

154
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,240
harm civilians please limit what you're

155
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,319
doing but we're watching we're just

156
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,800
helpless and just watching a horrible

157
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,000
scene just unfold with no real

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,520
leverage yeah I think that's exactly

159
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,879
what's happening I mean just to talk

160
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,360
about the United States we have uh the

161
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,000
potential uh to bring this uh bombing

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,520
campaign to an end we have huge

163
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,759
potential leverage over Israel there's

164
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,280
no question about it but it's almost

165
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,879
impossible for any president including

166
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,759
President Biden obviously uh to use any

167
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,560
of that leverage and uh the end result

168
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,280
is we can say that we hope Israel uh

169
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,960
will limit this campaign and do

170
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,440
everything it can to minimize civilian

171
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,680
casualties but we don't do anything

172
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,360
concrete or at least we haven't done

173
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,280
anything concrete up to this point to

174
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,599
prevent uh the Israelis from killing

175
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,639
large numbers of civilians and by the

176
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,720
way it's not just the Americans the

177
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,360
Europeans uh are doing nothing

178
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,479
themselves uh the Germans and the

179
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
British their behavior is especially

180
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
egregious on this front but even in the

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,440
Arab world uh you don't see uh the

182
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,000
Elites in the Arab world uh doing very

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
much to put an end to this and in fact

184
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,720
there's all sorts of evidence that in

185
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
the Arab world it's pressure from below

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,680
uh that is largely motivating the elites

187
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,080
to criticize what the Israelis are doing

188
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
uh and it's a tragic situation and it is

189
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,319
quite remarkable in the year

190
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,800
2023 uh that uh the Israelis are able to

191
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,080
get away with this what do you think

192
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,880
Israel

193
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,320
wants uh if not a two-state solution oh

194
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
it's very clear to me what Israel wants

195
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,000
and we're talking here about the uh the

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,200
government they want to ethnically

197
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,120
cleanse uh Gaza and they want to

198
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,720
ethnically cleanse uh the West Bank the

199
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,440
problem that the Israelis face Steve is

200
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,720
that inside greater Israel and greater

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,519
Israel includes Gaza the West Bank and

202
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,480
green line Israel there are

203
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
approximately uh

204
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,399
7.3 million Palestinians and there are

205
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,240
approximately 7.3 million Jews so you

206
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,920
have rough equality in the number of

207
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,440
Jews and Palestinians inside greater

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,800
Israel and that means you can have a

209
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,880
democratic State and if you don't want a

210
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,519
two-state solution then what are you

211
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,240
going to do well up to now the answer is

212
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,680
quite clear Israel has turned into an

213
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,959
apart time state it is an apartheid

214
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,200
state and the Israelis understand that

215
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,920
over the long term this is probably not

216
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,200
viable we all know what happened to

217
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,120
South Africa can Israel exist over the

218
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,320
long term as an apartheid state and you

219
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,079
want to remember that groups like Human

220
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,480
Rights Watch uh Amnesty International

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
Bellum and so forth and so on have

222
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,120
labeled Israel as an aparti state so

223
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,839
they want to get out of that situation

224
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,040
and the best way to do that from their

225
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,120
point of view is to ethnically cleanse

226
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
uh the ga the Gaza Strip and the West

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
Bank much like they ethnically cleansed

228
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
large parts of green line Israel in 1948

229
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
and much the way they cleansed large

230
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,200
parts of the West Bank in

231
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,959
1967 the problem is that they have not

232
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,040
been able to do that and the United

233
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,760
States much to its credit has at least

234
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,519
said that it will not uh countenance

235
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,800
Israel ethnically cleansing Gaza but

236
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,519
we'll see what happens there the

237
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,360
Israelis are punishing the civilian

238
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
population in Gaza in large part in my

239
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
opinion to drive them out but they have

240
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,399
not been successful so far I want to

241
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,839
play For You John a clip um of Danny

242
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,800
Danon Israel's former ambassador of the

243
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,760
United Nations in 2019 and something he

244
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,639
said about what's behind Israel's goals

245
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,560
listen this is a deed to our

246
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,680
land he's holding up the Bible basically

247
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,279
the Old Testament to say this is the

248
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,000
deed to our lands in the United Nations

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
and I'm just asking you as sort of an

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,440
analyst to say if that's what we're

251
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,959
working with and America is allied with

252
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:26,680
that how does this ever get to a

253
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,560
different point than just an ongoing

254
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,120
horrible convulsive

255
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,920
ulcer it doesn't I mean this is where we

256
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,399
are and by the way if you look at the

257
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,480
demographics inside of Israel the people

258
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,639
who are most likely to make the

259
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,040
argument uh that was just made uh that

260
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,639
you know the Bible is Israel's deed uh

261
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,600
to owning all of Greater Israel uh the

262
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,360
people who are most likely to make that

263
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
argument are the ultra orthodox and the

264
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,040
old Orthodox now form about

265
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,399
133% of Israel's

266
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,040
population uh but over time their

267
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
numbers are going to increase greatly up

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,360
to the point where in about the year

269
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,240
2050 uh you're going to have about 30%

270
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,279
of Israel close to onethird of Israel

271
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,279
will be uh Ultra Orthodox and that's

272
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,199
because the birth rate among old

273
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,120
Orthodox women is so high uh this means

274
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,920
that the argument that Danny Denon was

275
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,839
just making is going to become heard

276
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,560
more widely in Israel it's not only

277
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,519
going to be people like him it's going

278
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,120
to be more and more Ultra Orthodox Jews

279
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,040
making that argument uh so this argument

280
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,519
is simply not going

281
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,920
away let me ask you about responsibility

282
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,399
to protect because right now in

283
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,800
Washington we have a couple of things

284
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,519
tied together uh American support of

285
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,399
Ukraine uh in in the Russia War a lot of

286
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,800
particularly um those in on the progress

287
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
agressive side of the foreign policy

288
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,959
we're talking about r2p the

289
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,240
responsibility to protect as one of the

290
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,079
animators of Americans support Ukraine

291
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,880
where are they with regards to the

292
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Israel Gaza conflict and the

293
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,399
responsibility to protect

294
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360
Palestinians I I hear remarkably little

295
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
from them uh there are all these people

296
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,680
who have been talking uh for years now

297
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,320
about the importance of

298
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,120
r2p uh the importance of Protec ing

299
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
human rights and you would expect all of

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,800
them to be uh loudly proclaiming that

301
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,639
what the Israelis are doing is

302
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,120
unacceptable and that the United States

303
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,079
has a moral responsibility to put an end

304
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,360
to all of this killing of civilians of

305
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,040
Palestinians but H you hear very little

306
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,279
from these human rights proponents and

307
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,440
uh from human rights groups uh inside

308
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,079
the United States uh the silence is

309
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,839
actually quite amazing you know when I

310
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,680
watch polls and what's going on it's

311
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,560
very clear that younger generation

312
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,480
Democrats particularly Democrats of

313
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,759
color but it's really broad SWA of

314
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,680
younger voters in the Democratic party

315
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,759
are very very uh uh frustrated with Joe

316
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,519
Biden's position on Israel Gaza and you

317
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,000
see a collapse in their support and when

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,560
you interview them and do focus groups

319
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,959
right now they say there's nothing

320
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,720
that's going to bring them to support

321
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,199
Joe Biden there's a more General problem

322
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,959
at play here uh and that is that Israel

323
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:33,040
has lots of support among people your

324
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,519
age and my age but once you begin to go

325
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,160
down uh and look at younger cohorts it's

326
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,519
a very different story there's a Harris

327
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,839
Harvard poll that came out very recently

328
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,000
that says that if you look at people

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,560
between the ages of 18 and 24 you survey

330
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,920
them and you ask them this question was

331
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,600
Hamas Justified in killing Israeli

332
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,880
citizens on October 7th we're not

333
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,839
talking about killing the military we're

334
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,560
talking about killing civilians in other

335
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,440
words was Hamas justified in what it did

336
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,360
on October 7th

337
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,279
51% of people in the United States

338
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,160
between the ages of 18 20 18 and 24 say

339
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,440
that Hamas was justified this is

340
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,600
stunning and then if you look at people

341
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,880
between the ages of 25 and 34 25 and 34

342
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,519
48 48% say that Hamas was justified in

343
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,000
what it did on October 7th so you see

344
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,319
that Israel has a real problem and of

345
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,959
course this problem manifests itself on

346
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,160
college campuses and that's why the

347
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,160
lobby is working overtime now to try to

348
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,360
shut down criticism of Israel uh at

349
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,160
universities and colleges and then uh

350
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,839
his last last interview Henry Kissinger

351
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,000
did with Axel Springer CEO Matias dner

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,079
Kissinger said that the problem

353
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,880
societies like the United States and

354
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,199
Germany had was letting in so many

355
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,240
refugees so many people from other

356
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,040
groups because they then become agents

357
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,880
for those other groups for those other

358
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,759
identities and it just seemed to me one

359
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:21,920
of the most

360
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,360
remarkable inhumane comments about the

361
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
importance of others outside like

362
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,519
Palestinians you know I'm interested in

363
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,120
that tension about race and identity

364
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,600
inside pluralistic societies right now

365
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,480
and whether or not we're trying to

366
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,399
wrestle that decency out of

367
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,839
ourselves well I would come at this from

368
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,959
a slightly different perspective uh I I

369
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,880
I don't like the Kissinger argument uh

370
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,839
about bringing uh people from different

371
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,079
ethnic backgrounds uh or different

372
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,759
countries into the United States the

373
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,959
United States is an immigrant culture I

374
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,800
think that's a wonderful thing and I

375
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,240
have no problem with bringing immigrants

376
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,720
into the United States I think it's

377
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,160
what's made bringing immigrants into the

378
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,959
United States in huge numbers in the

379
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,600
19th century is what made this country

380
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,959
great and uh it's will will keep this

381
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,480
country powerful into the future so I

382
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,079
have no problem with immigration the

383
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,240
issue for me is uh how to think about

384
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
realist Behavior

385
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,960
versus moral behavior when you think

386
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,559
about how a state should act in the

387
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,640
International System and I fully

388
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,039
understand that states have a

389
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:44,640
deep-seated interest in security

390
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,919
competition for the purposes of

391
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,640
maximizing their chances of surviving

392
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
and I fully understand that states

393
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,080
sometimes do ruthless things to other

394
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,120
states for good strategic reasons

395
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,240
okay but at the same time there has to

396
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,720
be a moral Dimension that underpins how

397
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,320
States behave towards other states and

398
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,480
as long as there are no sort of

399
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,760
strategic reasons or realist reasons for

400
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,799
behaving ruthlessly States should go to

401
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,440
Great Lengths to act in a moral way I

402
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,400
have no problem making that argument and

403
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,440
I think in the case of what's going on

404
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,080
inside of

405
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
Gaza

406
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,640
uh there is no strategic reason for

407
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,799
Israel to destroy Palestinian Society to

408
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,559
kill huge numbers of civilians it it

409
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,120
just doesn't make good strategic sense

410
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,039
and I believe it is morally wrong uh so

411
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,640
this is why I am so deeply opposed to it

412
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,480
I think there's no question that Israel

413
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360
has the right I use that word Loosely it

414
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,880
has the right to go after Hamas Hamas

415
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,039
attacked Israel Israel can go after

416
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,880
Hamas and I understand that as Israel

417
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,080
goes after Hamas there's going to be

418
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,360
collateral damage civilians are going to

419
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,600
be killed this happens in Wartime it is

420
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
regrettable but it is a basic fact of

421
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,640
life it's very different than purposely

422
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,720
targeting uh civilians uh for the

423
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,320
purposes of inflicting massive pain and

424
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,880
Punishment on them

425
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
and again this has no strategic logic

426
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
there's there's no sort of realist

427
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,120
reason for doing this and therefore I

428
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,880
think it's deeply

429
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,039
wrong do you see any chance at all

430
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,559
America will in any time you know close

431
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,120
to now turn off that tap it's a rare

432
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
occasion when the United States puts

433
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
course of Leverage on Israel especially

434
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,159
when it comes to dealing with the

435
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,880
Palestinians uh and that's because any

436
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,520
government including the Biden

437
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,000
Administration understands full well

438
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,240
that if we are to get rough with the

439
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Israelis or we were to get rough with

440
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,440
the Israelis the Israel Lobby would come

441
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,480
after the administration hammer and

442
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
tongue and the administration doesn't

443
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,159
want that especially since we're moving

444
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,679
into an election year are we going to be

445
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,480
complicit do you think in the

446
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,600
possibility of equations that are in

447
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,679
fact ethnic

448
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,760
cleansing well there's not a growing

449
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,640
clamor I mean there's no question that

450
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,400
uh this is a

451
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
powerful uh motive uh on the right

452
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,600
inside of Israel and inside of the

453
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,720
United States uh the United States has

454
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,400
made it clear uh the US government the

455
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,000
Biden Administration has made it clear

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,120
that that's

457
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,640
unacceptable uh the question is what

458
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,880
happens if the Israelis just do it

459
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,039
uh when could argue that you know we're

460
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,960
marching towards the point where there

461
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
may be massive ethnic cleansing uh if

462
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,360
this bombing continues and the Israelis

463
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,760
continue to prevent uh water and food

464
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,159
and Medicine uh from coming into Gaza in

465
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,320
large enough amounts uh it could be that

466
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,720
the Palestinians begin to move out of

467
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,559
Gaza and that the Israelis uh do

468
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,840
everything they can to facilitate that

469
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,279
just hard to say how this plays out

470
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,480
moving forward but the Israelis could

471
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,559
just do it and just ignore uh what the

472
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,000
Biden Administration is saying about

473
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,640
what is that is not acceptable so it

474
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,440
remains a real possibility and as I said

475
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,919
to you before you want to understand

476
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:50,880
that the Israelis basically have two

477
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,480
choices here whether to continue

478
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,039
operating as an apartheid state and to

479
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,120
continue keeping Gaza as basically a

480
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,480
giant open air prison or to ethnically

481
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,440
cleanse Gaza and the West Bank at the

482
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,840
same time if they can now they would

483
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,159
definitely prefer to do that and uh the

484
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,279
the Administration has said you can't do

485
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,200
that but again how that plays itself out

486
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,480
uh remains to be seen well the Biden

487
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,360
Administration uh keeps trying to say

488
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,039
that it wants the ground war to end by

489
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,559
Year's End I don't see that happen I see

490
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,640
this as a story we're going to be having

491
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
to continue to focus on for some time

492
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,520
John I hope you'll come back and keep

493
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,120
sharing your perspectives as this

494
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,400
evolves thank you so much for joining us

495
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,880
professor John Mir shimer of the

496
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,200
University of Chicago thank you Steve

497
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,760
for having me on the show so what's the

498
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,960
bottom line Israel's forces have

499
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
destroyed more than 100,000 buildings in

500
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,159
Gaza that's on top of the killing of

501
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,720
thousands of women and children

502
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,080
Innocents and it implies a different

503
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,320
objective in this war according to at

504
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,640
least one Israeli cabinet official the

505
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,960
emphasis is on quote unquote damage not

506
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,720
accuracy this conflict the babies buried

507
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
in the rubble of collapsed apartment

508
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
buildings the destruction of bakeries

509
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,200
that provide bread the parading of

510
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,400
captured Palestinian men and underwear

511
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,440
all of it is going to be seared into the

512
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,880
minds of not only Palestinian victims

513
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,240
but all of us there's no moral High

514
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,000
Ground here there's no sense that

515
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,279
innocent Palestinian people matter in

516
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,600
any equation they were a burden and a

517
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,840
new in the eyes of many in Israel

518
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,600
particularly settlers before October 7th

519
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,039
they're looked at as inhuman the US

520
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,679
government is complicit in the horrors

521
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,159
we are seeing it's just nonsensical it's

522
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,480
an orwellian Circle where America thinks

523
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,440
it can both be seen as a legitimate Ally

524
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,400
of palestine's interests while it sits

525
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,320
coldly on the side of Israel's

526
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,600
untempered war machine that only cares

527
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,440
about damage and that's sadly the bottom

528
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
line
